				Registration is now closed. We have filled all our spots and have a waiting list. Please note that the registration numbers assigned to individual campers do not necessarily reflect their position in the queue - time of registration was not the only factor. We also needed to consider age and gender of the applicants when putting together the list of campers. Thank you for your patience during this new online registration process.
