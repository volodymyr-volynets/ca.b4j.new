				<!--Registration is now closed. We have filled all our spots and have a waiting list. Please note that the registration numbers assigned to individual campers do not necessarily reflect their position in the queue - time of registration was not the only factor. We also needed to consider age and gender of the applicants when putting together the list of campers. Thank you for your patience during this new online registration process.-->

				<h2><?php echo i18n(null, 'HOW MUCH?'); ?></h2>
			</div>
			<p>
				Cost is <code>$25</code> per screen.
			</p>
			<p>
Children will be divided into two different groups by grade level: 3-5 or 6-8.  Each screen can only be applied to one group. If you have children in two different grade levels and wish to only register one screen, you must decide which group your children will attend. 
			</p>
			<p>
Parents will be asked to prepare/purchase some supplies for camp activities (art and crafts).  This cost will be minimal and most supplies you may have at home. A list will be emailed 1-2 weeks prior to camp. 
			</p>
			<p>
For example: The Choly family has 2 children, grades 3 and 8.  If the family registers for one screen, they will need to decide which age group both the children will attend via Zoom. If they choose 6-8, both children will attend the 6-8 activities. If the Cholys wish to have their children attend activities separately, i.e., with their respective age group, they will need to register for 2 screens (one per child).
			</p>
			<p>
Please note that, unlike in previous years, no code is needed to register!
